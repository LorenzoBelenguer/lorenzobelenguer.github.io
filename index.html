    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Lorenzo Belenguer holds an MA in Artificial Intelligence & Philosophy from the New College of the Humanities, London, and a BA (Hons) in Economics and Business Sciences from the University of Valencia, Spain. Belenguer is particularly interested in: Ethical Frameworks (as Frameworks of Action), Human Interaction with AI and Machine Learning to develop a technology for the benefit of society as a whole, especially groups who have been historically marginalised, such as women, the LGTBQIA+ and indigenous community, and the sector of society surviving on a low income. Belenguer self-identifies as nonbinary. As a visual artist, he is interested in the power of the Arts to evolve into a more compassionate society and its power for healing. He was born in Valencia (Spain), and has been based in London for the last 20 years.</p>

    <h2>My paper being quoted in books and other papers</h2>
    <ul>
     <p><i>"Frequently, the data used to train AI contains bias. Belenguer notes that the data is not only biased, but also unrepresentative of people of colour, women, and other marginalised groups."</i></p>
